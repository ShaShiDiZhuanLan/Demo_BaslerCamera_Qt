        //! \brief Issue a broadcast action command.
        /**
        \param[in] deviceKey   The device key addresses devices managed by an application.
                               The device key is only known to the application controlling its camera devices
                               and it ensures that only this application can trigger the camera devices.
                               Therefore the device key cannot be read from a device.
                               An exact match of the send \c deviceKey and the device key stored in a device
                               is required for executing an action.

        \param[in] groupKey    The group key is used to create groups of devices or actions.
                               An exact match of the send \c groupKey and the group key stored in a device
                               for an action is required for executing an action.

        \param[in] groupMask   The groupMask is a bit mask that allows to send an action to a subgroup
                               of the devices addressed by the \c deviceKey \c groupKey pair.
                               The result of a bitwise AND operation of \c groupMask and the group mask
                               stored in a device for an action must be non-zero for executing an action.

        \param[in] broadcastAddress   BroadcastAddress in dot notation where the command will be broadcast to,
                                      e.g. 255.255.255.255 (all adapters, default),
                                      192.168.1.255 (all devices in a single subnet 192.168.1.xxx),
                                      192.168.1.38 (single device).
                                      See the note below.

        \param[in] timeoutMs   Optional: Time in milliseconds the call is waiting for acknowledges of the addressed devices.
                                Waiting for acknowledges is stopped if \c pNumResults have been received.
                                This parameter can be 0 if a check of action command results is not required.

        \param[in,out] pNumResults      Optional: The number of results in the \c results array.
                                        The value passed should be equal to the expected number of devices that acknowledge the command.
                                        Returns the number of received results.
                                        This parameter is ignored if \c timeoutMs is 0.
                                        Thus this parameter can be NULL if \c timeoutMs is 0.

        \param[out] results             Optional: An Array with \c *pNumResults elements to hold the action command result status.
                                        The buffer is filled beginning from the start. Remaining results are
                                        not changed if less results are received than result items available.
                                        This parameter is ignored if \c timeoutMs is 0.
                                        Thus this parameter can be NULL if \c timeoutMs is 0.


        \return Returns true if *pNumResults have been received and the \c Status of all results is \c GigEActionCommandStatus_Ok.
                Returns true if no results have been requested.

        The action command feature lets you trigger actions in multiple devices (e.g. cameras) at roughly
        the same time or at a defined point in time (scheduled action command) by using a single broadcast protocol message (without extra cabling). Action
        commands are used in cameras in the same way as for example the digital input lines.

        \note If a Microsoft Windows operating system is used, sending a broadcast out on multiple network interfaces
        is executed for each interface sequentially. That's why additional latency is added to the execution time
        of a command, when sending a broadcast message over a wider broadcast address range than needed, e.g. when using
        the broadcast address 255.255.255.255.

        See \ref sample_Grab_UsingActionCommand and Pylon::CActionTriggerConfiguration for more information.
