    \class  CGrabResultPtr
    \brief  A smart pointer holding a reference to grab result data.

    This class is used for distributing the grab result data of a camera. It controls
    the reuse and lifetime of the referenced buffer. When all smart pointers referencing
    a buffer go out of scope the referenced buffer is reused or destroyed.
    The data and the held buffer are still valid after the camera object it originated from
    has been destroyed.
    \attention The grabbing will stop with an input queue underrun, when the grab results are
    never released, e.g. when put into a container.

    The CGrabResultPtr class provides a cast operator that allows passing the grab result directly to functions or methods
    that take an const IImage& as parameter, e.g. image saving functions or image format converter methods.

    \attention The returned reference to IImage is only valid as long the CGrabResultPtr object it came from is not destroyed.

    \threading Instances of CGrabResultPtr referencing the same grab result can be used from any thread context.
