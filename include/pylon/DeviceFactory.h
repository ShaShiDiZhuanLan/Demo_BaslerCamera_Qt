    \brief This method can be used to check if a camera device can be created and opened.

    This method accepts either a device info object from a device enumeration or a user-provided device info object.
    User-provided device info objects can be preset with properties required for a device, e.g.
    the user-provided name or the serial number. The implementation tries to find a matching camera by using device
    enumeration.
    When the device class property is set, the search is limited to the required transport layer.

    \param[in]  deviceInfo         Properties of the camera device.
    \param[in]  mode               Used for defining how a device is accessed.
                                   The use of the mode information is transport layer-specific.
                                   For IIDC 1394 devices the mode information is ignored.
                                   For GigE devices the \c Exclusive and \c Control flags are used for defining how a device is accessed.
    \param[in]  pAccessibilityInfo Optionally provides more information about why a device is not accessible.
    \return True if device can be opened with provided access mode.

    \pre The \c deviceInfo object properties specify exactly one device.
         This is the case when the device info object has been obtained using device enumeration.

    \error
         Throws a C++ exception, if the preconditions are not met.
