    \class  CPylonImage
    \brief  Describes an image.

    <ul>
    <li> Automatically handles size and lifetime of the image buffer.
    <li> Allows to take over a buffer of grab result which is preventing its reuse as long as required.
    <li> Allows to connect user buffers or buffers provided by third party software packages.
    <li> Provides methods for loading and saving an image in different file formats.
    <li> Serves as the main target format for the image format converter \c CImageFormatConverter.
    <li> Eases working with planar images.
    <li> Eases extraction of AOIs, e.g. for thumbnail images of defects.
    </ul>

    \par Buffer Handling:
    The buffer that is automatically created by the CPylonImage class or a hosted grab result buffer are replaced by a larger buffer if required.
    The size of the allocated buffer is never decreased.
    Referenced user buffers are never automatically replaced by a larger buffer.
    Referenced grab result buffers are never reused. See the Reset() method for more details.
    The Release() method can be used to detach a user buffer, release a hosted grab result buffer or to free an allocated buffer.

    \threading
        The CPylonImage class is not thread-safe.
