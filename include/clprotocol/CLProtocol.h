\brief Connects and identifies the device and returns a DeviceID

    This function connects to a device attached to the serial port and attempts to identify it using the DeviceID template as hint. 
    If the function is successful it returns a DeviceID as well as a Cookie. The DeviceID has the form:

        <CODE>"CameraManufacturer#CameraFamily#CameraModel#Version.2.3.4#SerialNumber"</CODE>

    The connection is made with 9600 baud which is the power up baud rate as defined by the CameraLink standard.

    This function attempts to re-connect the device if a DeviceID is passed instead of a template as pDeviceIDTemplate.


\param[in] pSerial Pointer to the interface giving access to the serial port

\param[in] pDeviceIDTemplate A pointer to NULL-terminated string containing a device ID template 
    (in the probe use case) or a device ID (in the connect use case)

\param[in, out] pDeviceID A pointer to a user-allocated buffer. If DeviceIDTemplate is valid
    and a device is found and identified the DLL copies a device ID to the buffer. 

\param[in,out] pBufferSize As an input, the value contains the size of the buffer that 
    is passed through the pDeviceID parameter. 
    On successful return, this parameter contains the number of bytes written into the buffer, 
    including the NULL termination character. 
    On CL_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, this parameter contains the size of the buffer needed to write 
    the data text.

\param[out] pCookie A token supplied by the driver dll which must be handed in by all functions
    called later to access the device. The dll's implementation can use this token to 
    cache information about the connected device thus avoiding to have to parse the deviceID again.
    Note that the cookie value must not be 0.

\param[in] TimeOut A timeout value in [ms] used during accessing the device. 
    Note that the execution of the function itself can take longer than TimeOut because more than one
    access might be necessary. 

\return At completion, this function returns one of the following status codes:
\retval CL_ERR_NO_ERR No error occurred
\retval CL_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL The pDeviceID buffer is too small
\retval CL_ERR_INVALID_DEVICEID The DeviceID is not recognized as valid by this dll
\retval CL_ERR_NO_DEVICE_FOUND There was no device found matching the DeviceID

\brief This function returns a list of XML IDs coded into a single string

XML IDs have the following form: 

<CODE>"SchemaVersion.1.1@CameraManufacturer#CameraFamily#CameraModel@XMLVersion.2.3.4"</CODE>

The first part of the XML ID denotes the major and minor version number of the XML schema. 
The last part of the XML ID denotes the major, minor, and subminor version number of the camera. 
Both version numbers mut be the same as given in the attributes of the RegisterDescription node 
of the corrensponding XML file.
The middle part of the XML ID must be a complete DeviceID.

The device templates are separated by tabulators.
The whole list is contained in a NULL terminated string.

\param[in] pSerial Pointer to the interface giving access to the serial port

\param[in] Cookie Token supplied by the driver dll via the clpProbeDevice function. 

\param[out] pXMLIDs A pointer to a user-allocated buffer into which the function 
    copies the list of XML IDs. The list may be empty in which case is contains of a '0' only.

\param[in,out] pBufferSize As an input, the value contains the size of the buffer that 
    is passed through the pXMLIDs parameter. 
    On successful return, this parameter contains the number of bytes written into the buffer, 
    including the NULL termination character. 
    On CL_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, this parameter contains the size of the buffer needed to write 
    the data text.

\param[in] TimeOut A timeout value in [ms] used during accessing the device. 
    Note that the execution of the function itself can take longer than TimeOut because more than one
    access might be necessary. 

\return At completion, this function returns one of the following status codes:

/*!
\brief This function retrieves an XML file from the camera if possible

The DLL may ask the camera for the XML code, or may have the code as a resource compiled in 
itself or even may have it's own private registry mechanism installed.
In order to support the latter use case the long DeviceID is supplied which contains
the driver dll's directory.

\param[in] pSerial Pointer to the interface giving access to the serial port

\param[in] Cookie Token supplied by the driver dll via the clpProbeDevice function. 

\param[in] pXMLID A pointer to a NULL terminated string containing the connected device's XML ID 

\param[out] pXMLBuffer A pointer to a user-allocated buffer. Can be NULL if only the size of the 
    buffer is requested (see pBufferSize)

\param[in,out] pBufferSize pBufferSize As an input, the value contains the size of the buffer that 
    is passed through the pDeviceID parameter. 
    On successful return, this parameter contains the number of bytes written into the buffer, 
    including the NULL termination character. 
    On CL_ERR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL, this parameter contains the size of the buffer needed to write

       Upon success, numBytes are copied into buffer. 
       In the case of any error, including CL_ERR_TIMEOUT, no data is copied into buffer.

\param[in] Cookie Token supplied by the driver dll via the clpProbeDevice function. 

\param[in] Address Address the data is to be read from 

\param[out] pBuffer Points to a user-allocated buffer. Upon a successful call, 
    buffer contains the data read from the serial device.  
    Caller should ensure that buffer is at least numBytes in size.

\param[in] BufferSize This is the number of bytes requested by the caller.

\param[in] TimeOut A timeout value in [ms] used during accessing the device.
    Note that there may be specific commands which may take longer than TimeOut to be 
    accessed. Since clpReadRegister is missing a CL_ERR_PENDING_WRITE mechanism the
    CLProcotol DLL may be forced for these commands to delay the return for more than TimeOut.

This function must be called if clpWriteRegister or clpContinueWriteRegister returns CL_ERR_PENDING_WRITE.
